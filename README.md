# Geometry World
A simple "math platformer" game made in 48 hours for [Global Game Jam 2014](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/geometry-world).

In Geometry World, the player manipulates line equations in order to generate different paths through the game space, allowing the player character to complete the game objectives.

The design goal of this project was to explore a novel game mechanic that could potentially be used as a teaching tool for students learning mathematics (specifically coordinate geometry and equations of lines).

This game is written in Javascript, using the [CreateJS](http://www.createjs.com/)/[EaselJS](http://www.createjs.com/easeljs) libraries.
